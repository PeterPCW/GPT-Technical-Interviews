# Central location for all of the questions without answers:

Can you demonstrate how you would use the Express.js Router to create a RESTful API endpoint that accepts a parameter and returns a JSON response?

How would you use Koa.js middleware to implement an authentication system that requires users to provide a JWT token in the headers of their HTTP requests?

Can you demonstrate how you would use Nest.js modules and providers to create a reusable service that interacts with a MongoDB database, and then use this service to implement a CRUD API endpoint for a specific resource?

How would you use Hapi.js plugins to implement a caching layer for a specific API endpoint that returns data that is expensive to compute, and configure the plugin to use Redis as the caching backend?

Can you demonstrate how you would use Meteor.js to implement a real-time chat application that uses WebSockets to transmit messages between users, and stores messages in a MongoDB database for persistence? Bonus points if you can also implement a simple user authentication system using Meteor.js accounts.

Can you demonstrate how you would create a JWT-based authentication API endpoint using Node.js, and use it to restrict access to a protected resource?

Can you demonstrate how you would create a RESTful API endpoint using Node.js and the Sequelize ORM, and use it to retrieve all records that meet a certain criteria from a MySQL database?

Can you demonstrate how you would create an API endpoint using Node.js and the Stripe API, and use it to charge a user's credit card for a specific amount?

Can you demonstrate how you would create a real-time chat API endpoint using Node.js and the Socket.io library, and use it to broadcast messages to all connected clients?

Can you demonstrate how you would create a RESTful API endpoint using Node.js and the Amazon S3 API, and use it to upload and download files to and from an S3 bucket?

How would you create an SQL schema and seed it with data using Node.js and the Sequelize ORM? Bonus points if you can demonstrate how you would create a migration to modify the schema.

How would you use Node.js and the Passport library to implement an authentication system that uses a local username/password strategy and stores user credentials securely using bcrypt hashing?

How would you optimize a slow MongoDB query using Node.js and the Mongoose ORM, and ensure that the query results are cached to avoid future slowdowns?

How would you use Node.js and the Redis database to implement a caching layer for a specific API endpoint that returns data that is expensive to compute, and configure the cache to automatically expire after a certain amount of time?

How would you use Node.js and the Knex.js library to implement a pagination system for a RESTful API endpoint that returns a large amount of data from a MySQL database, and ensure that the pagination logic is efficient and scalable?

How would you use Node.js and the Mocha testing framework to write unit tests for a simple API endpoint that returns the sum of two numbers, ensuring that the endpoint handles invalid inputs correctly and returns the expected result?

How would you use Node.js and the built-in debugging tools to debug a server-side issue that is causing a crash when a specific API endpoint is called, and determine the root cause of the problem?

How would you use Node.js and the Express.js middleware to implement a centralized error handling system for a RESTful API that returns meaningful error messages to the client when errors occur, and logs detailed error information to a file or database for debugging purposes?

How would you refactor a large and complex Node.js server codebase to improve maintainability and scalability, and ensure that the code is easy to debug and test? Bonus points if you can demonstrate how you would use TypeScript or other tools to enforce good coding practices.

How would you ensure that a Node.js server codebase stays up-to-date with the latest security patches and dependencies, and avoid potential compatibility issues and vulnerabilities? Bonus points if you can demonstrate how you would use a CI/CD pipeline and automated testing to ensure that changes are deployed safely and reliably.

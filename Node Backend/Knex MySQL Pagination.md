# How would you use Node.js and the Knex.js library to implement a pagination system for a RESTful API endpoint that returns a large amount of data from a MySQL database, and ensure that the pagination logic is efficient and scalable?

To implement a pagination system for a RESTful API endpoint that returns a large amount of data from a MySQL database using Node.js and the Knex.js library, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the page size and the current page number based on the client request. Typically, the page size is set to a fixed value (e.g., 10 or 20), and the current page number is passed as a query parameter (e.g., **`?page=1`**).
2. Use Knex.js to query the MySQL database and retrieve the data for the current page. To do this, we can use the **`limit`** and **`offset`** methods provided by Knex.js to limit the number of results returned and skip over any previous results. For example:

```typescript
const pageSize = 10;
const currentPage = req.query.page || 1;
const offset = (currentPage - 1) * pageSize;

const data = await knex('my_table')
  .select('*')
  .limit(pageSize)
  .offset(offset);
```

This query selects all columns (**`*`**) from the **`my_table`** table, limits the number of results to **`pageSize`**, and skips over the first **`offset`** results (i.e., the results from previous pages).

3. Count the total number of results in the database table. We need to know the total number of results to calculate the total number of pages and determine whether there are more pages to display. To do this, we can use the **`count`** method provided by Knex.js. For example:

```typescript
const totalCount = await knex('my_table').count('* as total_count').first();
```

This query returns a single row with a **`total_count`** column that contains the total number of rows in the **`my_table`** table.

4. Calculate the total number of pages based on the page size and the total number of results. We can use simple arithmetic to do this:

```typescript
const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalCount.total_count / pageSize);
```

This calculation divides the total number of results by the page size and rounds up to the nearest integer using **`Math.ceil`**.

5. Return the current page data and pagination metadata as a JSON response. The JSON response should include the data for the current page, as well as metadata such as the total number of results, the current page number, and the total number of pages. For example:

```typescript
res.json({
  data,
  metadata: {
    total_count: totalCount.total_count,
    current_page: currentPage,
    total_pages: totalPages,
    has_next_page: currentPage < totalPages,
    has_prev_page: currentPage > 1,
  },
});
```

This response includes the data for the current page (**`data`**) and metadata such as the total number of results (**`total_count`**), the current page number (**`current_page`**), the total number of pages (**`total_pages`**), and flags indicating whether there are more pages to display (**`has_next_page`** and **`has_prev_page`**).

By following these steps, we can implement an efficient and scalable pagination system for a RESTful API endpoint that returns a large amount of data from a MySQL database using Node.js and the Knex.js library.

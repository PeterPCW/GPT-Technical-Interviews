# Given a large-scale React application with multiple components and stylesheets, how would you structure the CSS using a preprocessor like Sass or Less? What are some best practices for organizing styles and managing dependencies between components?

**1. Use a Modular Architecture**

Using a modular architecture is essential to organize your styles in a scalable and maintainable way. You can use Sass or Less to define modular stylesheets for each component or feature of your application. This way, you can easily reuse and modify styles without affecting other components.

**2. Define a Consistent Naming Convention**

Defining a consistent naming convention for your styles is critical to avoid naming collisions and make your styles more readable and understandable. You can use BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) or a similar naming convention to define unique and descriptive class names for your styles.

**3. Use Variables and Mixins**

Using variables and mixins is a powerful way to reuse and customize styles across your application. You can define variables for colors, fonts, sizes, and other properties that you use frequently, and reuse them throughout your stylesheets. You can also define mixins for common styles, such as borders, gradients, and shadows, and reuse them across your components.

**4. Use a Global Stylesheet for Base Styles**

Using a global stylesheet for base styles is a good practice to define styles that apply to the entire application, such as typography, layout, and reset styles. You can import this stylesheet into your component stylesheets and use it to build on top of the base styles.

**5. Use a Style Guide and Pattern Library**

Using a style guide and pattern library is a valuable way to document and share your styles across your team and stakeholders. You can use tools like Storybook or Styleguidist to create a living style guide that showcases your components and their styles. You can also use a pattern library to define reusable UI patterns, such as buttons, forms, and cards, that you can use throughout your application.

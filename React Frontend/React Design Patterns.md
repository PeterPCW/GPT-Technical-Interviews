  <summary>What are some common design patterns used in React applications? How would you use these patterns to build a scalable, maintainable application that can connect to a microservice backend?</summary>
  
  React is a powerful and popular front-end library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. To build scalable, maintainable applications that can connect to a microservice backend, it's important to use design patterns that help organize your code and make it easier to manage and extend over time.

  ### **1. Container/Presenter Pattern**

  The Container/Presenter pattern is a popular design pattern used in React applications. This pattern separates the logic and data fetching responsibilities from the presentation of components. In this pattern, the container component fetches the data and passes it to the presenter component as props. The presenter component is then responsible for rendering the data.

  This pattern can be used to build scalable, maintainable applications that can connect to a microservice backend. By separating the data fetching and presentation responsibilities, you can easily change the data source without affecting the presentation layer.

  ### **2. Higher-Order Components (HOC)**

  Higher-Order Components (HOC) is another design pattern used in React applications. This pattern allows you to reuse code and logic across multiple components. A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props.

  HOCs can be used to build scalable, maintainable applications that can connect to a microservice backend. For example, you can create an HOC that handles authentication and authorization logic and wraps your components that require authentication and authorization.

  ### **3. Render Props**

  Render Props is a design pattern used in React applications that allows you to share code and logic between components. This pattern involves passing a function as a prop to a component, which then uses that function to render its content.

  Render Props can be used to build scalable, maintainable applications that can connect to a microservice backend. For example, you can create a component that fetches data from a microservice backend and pass a render prop that defines how that data should be displayed.

  ### **4. Redux**

  Redux is a state management library for React applications. This library provides a predictable state container that can be used to manage the state of your application. Redux is based on three principles: single source of truth, state is read-only, and changes are made with pure functions.

  Redux can be used to build scalable, maintainable applications that can connect to a microservice backend. By using Redux, you can centralize your application's state and easily manage state changes across your application.

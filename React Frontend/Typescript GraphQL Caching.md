# You are building a React application that needs to display data from a GraphQL API. What are some best practices for managing queries and caching data within the application, and how would you ensure that the data is correctly typed using TypeScript?

When building a React application that needs to display data from a GraphQL API, there are several best practices you can follow to manage queries and caching data. In this section, we will discuss these best practices and how to ensure that the data is correctly typed using TypeScript.

**Managing GraphQL Queries**

One of the key benefits of using GraphQL is that it allows you to retrieve only the data you need. However, as your application grows, managing GraphQL queries can become a challenge. Here are some best practices for managing GraphQL queries:

1. Use GraphQL fragments to share query logic.
2. Use Apollo Client's Query component to fetch and manage queries.
3. Use Apollo Client's useQuery hook to manage queries with hooks.
4. Use Apollo Client's cache to store and retrieve cached data.
5. Use Apollo Client's watchQuery to observe changes to cached data.

**Caching Data**

Caching data is important for performance and reducing the number of requests to the server. Apollo Client provides a built-in cache that allows you to store and retrieve data. Here are some best practices for caching data:

1. Use Apollo Client's cache to store and retrieve data.
2. Use Apollo Client's writeQuery and writeFragment methods to update the cache.
3. Use Apollo Client's readQuery and readFragment methods to retrieve data from the cache.
4. Use Apollo Client's normalizeCacheObject method to normalize data before storing it in the cache.

**TypeScript Support**

TypeScript is a powerful tool for ensuring that your code is correctly typed. When using a GraphQL API, TypeScript can help you ensure that the data you are retrieving is correctly typed. Here are some best practices for using TypeScript with GraphQL:

1. Use GraphQL Code Generator to automatically generate TypeScript types for your GraphQL queries and mutations.
2. Use TypeScript interfaces to define the expected shape of your data.
3. Use TypeScript enums to define the possible values of a field.
4. Use TypeScript's keyof operator to ensure that you are accessing valid fields.

# Write a TypeScript interface that defines the expected response schema for a REST API endpoint that returns a list of users. How would you use this interface to validate the API response and ensure that the data is correctly typed throughout your React components?

Here's an example TypeScript interface that defines the expected response schema for a REST API endpoint that returns a list of users:

```tsx
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}
```

To validate the API response and ensure that the data is correctly typed throughout your React components, you can use TypeScript's built-in **`fetch`** API to fetch data from the API endpoint and type-check the response using the interface you defined.

Here's an example of how you can use the interface to validate the API response and ensure that the data is correctly typed:

```tsx
// Define the interface for the API response
interface UserApiResponse {
  users: User[];
}

// Fetch the API endpoint and type-check the response using the interface
fetch('/api/users')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data: UserApiResponse) => {
    // The data variable now has the correct type and can be used throughout your React components
    const { users } = data;

    // ...
  });
```

In this example, we define an additional interface called **`UserApiResponse`** that wraps the **`User`** interface in an object with a **`users`** property that is an array of **`User`** objects. We then use this interface to type-check the response of the API endpoint.

Once the response is validated, you can use the **`users`** array throughout your React components with the correct typing:

```tsx
function UserList({ users }: { users: User[] }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>
          {user.name} ({user.age})
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/users')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data: UserApiResponse) => {
        setUsers(data.users);
      });
  }, []);

  return <UserList users={users} />;
}
```

In this example, we define a **`UserList`** component that takes an array of **`User`** objects as a prop and renders them as a list. We then use the **`useState`** and **`useEffect`** hooks to fetch the user data from the API endpoint and update the state of the **`App`** component with the retrieved data.

By using the **`User`** interface to define the expected response schema and type-checking the response with the **`UserApiResponse`** interface, we can ensure that the data is correctly typed throughout our React components.

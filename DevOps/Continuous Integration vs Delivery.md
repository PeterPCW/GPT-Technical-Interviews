# Explain the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. What is the purpose of Continuous Integration, and how does it help ensure software quality? Describe the steps involved in implementing Continuous Integration with Jenkins, including the setup of a Jenkins pipeline.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are two related but distinct practices in software development. CI is the practice of regularly and automatically building, testing, and integrating changes to a codebase, while CD is the practice of automatically deploying those changes to a production environment.

The purpose of CI is to ensure that code changes are integrated and tested frequently, allowing developers to catch and fix bugs early in the development process. By automating the build and test process, CI helps to reduce the risk of introducing bugs and other issues into the codebase.

The steps involved in implementing Continuous Integration with Jenkins are:

1. Install and configure Jenkins: Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server used for CI/CD. Install Jenkins on a server or cloud instance and configure it with the necessary plugins, security settings, and integrations.

2. Create a Jenkins pipeline: A pipeline is a series of stages and steps that define the CI/CD workflow. Create a Jenkins pipeline that defines the build, test, and integration process for your codebase.

3. Configure source code management: Connect your code repository (e.g., Git) to Jenkins to automatically trigger builds and tests when code changes are pushed.

4. Define build and test steps: Define the steps required to build and test your codebase, including compiling code, running unit tests, and generating build artifacts.

5. Automate integration testing: Configure integration tests to be automatically run as part of the CI process. This ensures that changes are properly integrated with the rest of the codebase and that the system as a whole is functioning correctly.

6. Report test results: Configure Jenkins to report test results and code coverage metrics to developers and stakeholders, providing visibility into the quality of the codebase and identifying areas that need improvement.

7. Use Jenkins to trigger other stages of the pipeline: Once the build and test process is complete, Jenkins can trigger other stages of the pipeline, such as deploying the code to a staging environment or triggering further testing.

Continuous Delivery, on the other hand, is the practice of automating the release process and continuously deploying changes to production environments. It involves automating the deployment process, including infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. The goal of CD is to ensure that software changes are released quickly and reliably to end-users, without introducing bugs or downtime.

  <summary>How does Ansible differ from Chef in terms of Configuration Management? Explain the Ansible Playbook structure and its components, and provide an example of a Playbook that installs and configures Nginx on a remote server.</summary>
  
  Ansible and Chef are both configuration management tools used for automating the deployment, configuration, and management of IT infrastructure. However, they differ in their approach to configuration management. Chef uses a master-agent architecture, where a Chef server acts as a central hub that manages the configuration of the agent nodes. Ansible, on the other hand, uses a push-based model where a central machine (the Ansible control node) communicates with and manages remote machines using SSH.

  An Ansible Playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be executed on one or more remote machines. It is composed of several sections, including:

  - **`hosts`**: defines the target machines or groups of machines to which the playbook should be applied.
  - **`vars`**: defines variables to be used throughout the playbook.
  - **`tasks`**: defines a set of actions to be executed on the target machines.
  - **`handlers`**: defines actions that should be taken when a task has been completed.
  - **`roles`**: a way to organize and group tasks into reusable components.

  Here is an example of an Ansible Playbook that installs and configures Nginx on a remote server:

  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Install and configure Nginx
    hosts: web_servers
    become: true
    vars:
      nginx_port: 80
      nginx_server_name: example.com
    tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Create Nginx virtual host file
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      notify:
        - restart nginx
    - name: Enable Nginx virtual host
      file:
        src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        state: link
      notify:
        - restart nginx
    handlers:
      - name: restart nginx
        service:
          name: nginx
          state: restarted
  ```

  This playbook first installs Nginx using the **`apt`** module, then creates a virtual host file using a Jinja2 template (**`nginx.conf.j2`**) and enables it by creating a symbolic link in the **`sites-enabled`** directory. Finally, it defines a handler to restart the Nginx service when the configuration has changed. The variables **`nginx_port`** and **`nginx_server_name`** are defined in the **`vars`** section and can be used throughout the playbook.

  To run this playbook on a group of servers named **`web_servers`**, you would execute the following command:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook nginx.yml -i inventory.ini
  ```

  where **`nginx.yml`** is the filename of the playbook and **`inventory.ini`** is a file that defines the list of hosts and their respective IP addresses or DNS names.

# GPT-Technical-Interviews

I am using chatGPT to generate technical interview questions related to roles I'm interested in, and then having it create the answers to test my knowledge against. Might as well make these public for others to use.

**BE WARNED:** These answers may be incomplete and/or incorrect since they are chatGPT generated. Always review and test code before using it in real applications.

To let you have a chance to solve the questions I will list them in a summary Readme in each category folder. Ones with answers uploaded are linked. Answers are saved by tool/topic in the same folder.

# GPT-Technical-Interviews

I am using chatGPT to generate technical interview questions related to roles I'm interested in, and then having it create the answers to test my knowledge against. Might as well make these public for others to use.

**BE WARNED:** These answers may be incomplete and/or incorrect since they are chatGPT generated. Always review and test code before using it in real applications.

To let you have a chance to solve the questions I will hide the answer in a collapsible like so:

<details>
  <summary>Interview Question Text</summary>
  
  ### Text/Verbal Response
  1. Explaination
  2. Details and Caveats
     * Like This one
     * Or maybe that

  ### Code Response
  ```js
  function whenApplicable(question) {
    console.log(code solution);
  }
  
  whenApplicable(InterviewQuestionText);
  ```
</details>

There is also a summary Readme in each category folder with all of the questions. Ones where I have uploaded the answers are linked.

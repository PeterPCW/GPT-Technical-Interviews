[Can you explain in detail how you implement fault tolerance and resilience in a distributed system using Spring Cloud and Netflix OSS?

Can you walk me through how you design and implement a scalable and fault-tolerant database architecture for a Java microservices application using Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB? What are the trade-offs between relational and NoSQL databases in a microservices context?

Write a Java Spring Boot microservice that exposes a RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete records from a database. The service should use JPA/Hibernate to interact with the database, and implement basic error handling and validation.

Implement a caching mechanism in a Java microservice using Spring Cache and Redis. The service should cache the response of a slow operation (e.g., a database query), and invalidate the cache when the underlying data changes.

Develop a Java Spring Boot microservice that consumes a third-party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), and exposes a simplified API to retrieve weather data for a given location. The service should use Feign to call the external API, and implement basic error handling and retries.

Implement a rate limiting feature in a Java Spring Boot microservice using Spring Cloud Gateway and Redis. The service should limit the number of requests that can be made per minute per user or IP address, and return an HTTP 429 error when the limit is exceeded.

Write a Java Spring Boot microservice that processes incoming messages from a message queue (e.g., Amazon SQS), and stores the data in a database. The service should use Spring Cloud Stream to consume messages asynchronously, and implement basic error handling and retry logic.

Design and implement a Java Spring Boot microservice that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store and retrieve data. The service should expose a RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete records, and use the DynamoDB SDK to interact with the database.

Develop a Java Spring Boot microservice that uses MongoDB to store and retrieve data, and expose a RESTful API to query the data using the MongoDB Query Language (MQL). The service should use the MongoDB Java Driver to interact with the database, and implement basic error handling and validation.

Write a Java Spring Boot microservice that uses Apache Cassandra to store and retrieve data, and expose a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations on the data. The service should use the DataStax Java Driver to interact with the database, and implement basic error handling and consistency levels.

Implement a Java Spring Boot microservice that uses Apache HBase to store and retrieve data, and expose a RESTful API to query the data using the HBase Java API. The service should use the HBase Java Client to interact with the database, and implement basic error handling and pagination.

Develop a Java Spring Boot microservice that uses Amazon DocumentDB to store and retrieve data in a MongoDB-compatible format, and expose a RESTful API to query the data using the MongoDB Query Language. The service should use the DocumentDB Java SDK to interact with the database, and implement basic error handling and validation.

Develop a Java program that reads a CSV file and generates an HTML report with the data. The program should use a third-party library like OpenCSV to parse the CSV file, and generate a simple HTML report with a table and some basic formatting.

Write a Java program that implements a basic command-line calculator. The program should accept two operands and an operator (+, -, \*, /) from the user, and display the result. The program should handle basic error cases (e.g., divide by zero), and allow the user to continue with additional calculations.

Implement a Java program that sorts a list of strings in alphabetical order. The program should have options for bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort, and handle empty and null lists.

Develop a Java program that calculates the frequency of each word in a given text file. The program should use a Map data structure to store the word frequencies, and handle common punctuation marks and capitalization.

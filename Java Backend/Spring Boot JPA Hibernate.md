  <summary>Write a Java Spring Boot microservice that exposes a RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete records from a database. The service should use JPA/Hibernate to interact with the database, and implement basic error handling and validation.</summary>
  
  Here's a basic Java Spring Boot microservice that exposes a RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete records from a database using JPA/Hibernate:

  ```java
  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api/users")
  public class UserController {

      @Autowired
      private UserRepository userRepository;

      // GET all users
      @GetMapping
      public List<User> getAllUsers() {
          return userRepository.findAll();
      }

      // GET a user by ID
      @GetMapping("/{id}")
      public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
          return userRepository.findById(id)
              .orElseThrow(() -> new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "User not found"));
      }

      // CREATE a new user
      @PostMapping
      @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
      public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
          return userRepository.save(user);
      }

      // UPDATE a user by ID
      @PutMapping("/{id}")
      public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
          return userRepository.findById(id)
              .map(existingUser -> {
                  existingUser.setName(user.getName());
                  existingUser.setEmail(user.getEmail());
                  return userRepository.save(existingUser);
              })
              .orElseThrow(() -> new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "User not found"));
      }

      // DELETE a user by ID
      @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
      public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
          userRepository.deleteById(id);
      }
  }
  ```

  Here's an explanation of what this code does:

  - The **`@RestController`** annotation marks this class as a REST controller, meaning that it will handle HTTP requests and return responses in JSON format.
  - The **`@RequestMapping`** annotation specifies the base URL path for all API endpoints in this controller.
  - The **`@Autowired`** annotation injects an instance of the **`UserRepository`** interface, which is used to interact with the database.
  - The **`@GetMapping`** annotation specifies an HTTP GET endpoint for retrieving all users from the database. The **`findAll()`** method provided by **`UserRepository`** is used to retrieve all users.
  - The **`@GetMapping`** annotation specifies an HTTP GET endpoint for retrieving a single user by ID from the database. The **`findById()`** method provided by **`UserRepository`** is used to retrieve the user with the given ID, and a **`ResponseStatusException`** is thrown with a **`NOT_FOUND`** status if the user does not exist.
  - The **`@PostMapping`** annotation specifies an HTTP POST endpoint for creating a new user in the database. The **`@RequestBody`** annotation indicates that the user data is provided in the request body, and the **`save()`** method provided by **`UserRepository`** is used to save the new user to the database.
  - The **`@PutMapping`** annotation specifies an HTTP PUT endpoint for updating an existing user in the database. The **`@PathVariable`** annotation indicates that the user ID is provided in the URL path, and the **`@RequestBody`** annotation indicates that the updated user data is provided in the request body. The **`findById()`** method provided by **`UserRepository`** is used to retrieve the existing user, the user data is updated, and the updated user is saved to the database using the **`save()`** method provided by **`UserRepository`**. A **`ResponseStatusException`** is thrown with a **`NOT_FOUND`** status if the user does not exist.
  - The **`@DeleteMapping`** annotation specifies an HTTP DELETE endpoint for deleting a user from the database. The **`@PathVariable`** annotation indicates that the user ID is provided in the URL path, and the **`deleteById()`** method provided by **`UserRepository`** is used to delete the user from the database.

  This code assumes that a **`User`** entity class and a **`UserRepository`** interface have been defined elsewhere in the application
